The official Github organization of Antares Programming

## What happened to the other Github organization?
If you've been following Antares Programming for a while, you may have noticed that we used to have the [antaresprogramming](https://github.com/antaresprogramming/) Github organization, along with the website's repository [antaresprogramming.github.io](https://github.com/antaresprogramming/antaresprogramming.github.io/). It was all managed by the creator Francis Rubio under the username [maniczirconium](https://github.com/maniczirconium). What happened is he forgot to create backups for his 2FA on most of his accounts, including Github, when he had to use a new mobile device. As it turned out, he has completely lost access to those accounts. ðŸ¤¦ Now, he has created and is managing this new Github organization under the username [manicadamantium](https://github.com/manicadamantium). This means, that we can no longer use the previous organization, nor can we take down or at least put a notice on the old site that says it is now defunct. It was a very silly yet serious mistake, and we apologize if you had been affected.

## New beginnings
